# Changelog

## 0.1.1-beta

- Tiles and summary labels wrap to two lines instead of being cut off ("Rozładowanie magazynu", "Samowystarczalność").
- Paper: the sentence lists only the sources in use, as shares of what they supply right now, adding up to 100% (it could show "battery 112%" when the inverter used part of the battery's power).
- Paper: the Sankey diagram has "From / To" headings and a grey "Losses" band for the power that goes into the inverter but not out of it, so both sides match.
